# Optimal polygon triangulation

- **Code Explanation:**
---

1. **`#include<bits/stdc++.h>`** is a C++ preprocessor directive that tells the compiler to include a standard C++ library called **`bits/stdc++.h`**. This library includes a large number of C++ standard library headers, including **`iostream`** and **`cmath`**, which are needed in this program.
2. **`#include<iostream>`** is a C++ preprocessor directive that tells the compiler to include the **`iostream`** library, which provides input/output stream objects.
3. **`#define MAX FLT_MAX`** is a preprocessor directive that defines a macro called **`MAX`** as the maximum value representable by a **`float`** type. The value of **`FLT_MAX`** is defined in the **`float.h`** header file as the maximum positive value representable by a **`float`**.
4. **`using namespace std;`** is a directive that tells the compiler to use the **`std`** namespace. This allows us to use functions and objects from the **`std`** namespace without explicitly specifying the namespace they belong to.
5. **`struct Point`** is a user-defined data type that represents a point in a 2D coordinate system. The **`struct`** keyword is used to define a structure, which is a user-defined data type that can hold multiple variables of different types. The **`Point`** structure has two member variables: **`x`** and **`y`**, which represent the x-coordinate and y-coordinate of the point, respectively.
6. **`float minVal(float a, float b)`** is a function that returns the minimum of two **`float`** type variables **`a`** and **`b`**.
7. **`float calcDist(Point points[], int i, int j, int k)`** is a function that calculates the distance between three points in a 2D coordinate system. The distance between two points is calculated using the Euclidean distance formula: **`sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2)`**, where **`(x1, y1)`** and **`(x2, y2)`** are the coordinates of the two points. The function takes an array of **`Point`** structures called **`points`**, and three integers **`i`**, **`j`**, and **`k`**, which represent the indices of the points in the array.
8. **`int main()`** is the main function of the program. This is the function where the program execution begins.
9. **`int numPoints;`** is a variable that will hold the number of points.
10. **`cout << "Input the number of points: ";`** is a line of code that prints the string "Input the number of points: " to the standard output stream (usually the console).
11. **`cin >> numPoints;`** is a line of code that reads an integer value from the standard input stream (usually the keyboard) and stores it in the **`numPoints`** variable.
12. **`Point points[numPoints];`** is an array of **`Point`** structures, with **`numPoints`** elements. This array will hold the coordinates of the points.
13. **`for(int i=0; i<numPoints; i++)`** is a loop that iterates **`numPoints`** times. In each iteration, the loop reads the coordinates of a point and stores them in the **`points`** array.

1. **`cout << "Input the value of x for point " << i+1 << ": ";`** is a line of code that prints the string "Input the value of x for point i+1: " to the standard output stream (usually the console), where **`i`** is the loop variable. This line of code prompts the user to input the x-coordinate of the point.
2. **`cin >> points[i].x;`** is a line of code that reads an integer value from the standard input stream (usually the keyboard) and stores it in the **`x`** member variable of the **`i`**th element of the **`points`** array.
3. **`cout << "Input the value of y for point " << i+1 << ": ";`** is a line of code that prints the string "Input the value of y for point i+1: " to the standard output stream (usually the console), where **`i`** is the loop variable. This line of code prompts the user to input the y-coordinate of the point.
4. **`cin >> points[i].y;`** is a line of code that reads an integer value from the standard input stream (usually the keyboard) and stores it in the **`y`** member variable of the **`i`**th element of the **`points`** array.
5. **`int n=sizeof(points)/sizeof(points[0]);`** is a line of code that calculates the number of elements in the **`points`** array and stores the result in the **`n`** variable. The **`sizeof`** operator is used to determine the size of the **`points`** array in bytes, and the size of a single element in the array (i.e., a **`Point`** structure) is determined using the **`sizeof`** operator as well. Dividing the size of the array by the size of a single element gives the number of elements in the array.
6. **`float dp[n][n];`** is a two-dimensional array of **`float`** type, with **`n`** rows and **`n`** columns. This array will be used to store the minimum length of a triangle that can be formed from a subset of the points.
7. **`int gap, i, j, k;`** are variables that will be used in the DP algorithm to iterate over the points in the **`points`** array.
8. **`for(gap=0; gap<n; gap++)`** is a loop that iterates over the points in the **`points`** array, starting from the smallest subproblems (i.e., triangles formed from three points) and working up to larger ones. The **`gap`** variable represents the gap between the indices of the points being considered.
9. **`for(i=0; i<n-gap; i++)`** is a nested loop that iterates over the points in the **`points`** array, starting from the first point and working up to the last point. The **`i`** variable represents the index of the first point being considered.
10. **`j=i+gap;`** is a line of code that calculates the index of the second point being considered, based on the value of the **`gap`** and **`i`** variables.
11. **`if(gap<2)`** is an **`if`** statement that checks if the gap between the indices of the points being considered is less than 2. If the gap is less than 2, it means that we are considering a triangle formed from three points.
12. **`if(gap<2)`** is an **`if`** statement that checks if the gap between the indices of the points being considered is less than 2. If the gap is less than 2, it means that we are considering a triangle formed from three points.
13. **`dp[i][j]=0;`** is a line of code that sets the value of the element at index **`[i][j]`** in the **`dp`** array to 0. This line of code is executed if the gap between the indices of the points being considered is less than 2.
14. **`else`** is a keyword that is used to specify the code that should be executed if the condition in the **`if`** statement is not met.
15. **`dp[i][j]=MAX;`** is a line of code that sets the value of the element at index **`[i][j]`** in the **`dp`** array to the maximum value representable by a **`float`**, which is defined as the **`MAX`** macro. This line of code is executed if the gap between the indices of the points being considered is greater than or equal to 2.
16. **`for(k=i+1; k<j; k++)`** is a loop that iterates over the points in the **`points`** array, starting from the index **`i+1`** and working up to the index **`j-1`**. The **`k`** variable represents the index of the third point being considered.
17. **`dp[i][j]=minVal(dp[i][j], dp[i][k]+dp[k][j]+calcDist(points, i, j, k));`** is a line of code that updates the value of the element at index **`[i][j]`** in the **`dp`** array with the minimum value of the current value and the value obtained by adding the minimum length of a triangle that can be formed from the points at indices **`i`** and **`k`**, the minimum length of a triangle that can be formed from the points at indices **`k`** and **`j`**, and the distance between the points at indices **`i`**, **`j`**, and **`k`**. The **`minVal`** function is used to calculate the minimum value, and the **`calcDist`** function is used to calculate the distance between the points.
18. The loop at line 28 iterates over all possible combinations of three points and calculates the minimum length of a triangle that can be formed from those points. The minimum value is then stored in the **`dp`** array for future reference.
19. The loop at line 21 iterates over all possible combinations of points and calculates the minimum length of a triangle that can be formed from those points. The minimum values are stored in the **`dp`** array for future reference.
20. **`cout << dp[0][n-1] << endl;`** is a line of code that prints the value of the element at index **`[0][n-1]`** in the **`dp`** array to the standard output stream, followed by a newline character. This value represents the minimum length of a triangle that can be formed from the entire set of points.
21. **`return 0;`** is a line of code that indicates the end of the **`main`** function and returns a value of 0 to the operating system, indicating that the program executed successfully.

- **Use of Dynamic Programming:**
---
Dynamic programming (DP) is a method of solving problems by breaking them down into smaller subproblems, solving each subproblem, and then combining the solutions to the subproblems to obtain a solution to the original problem.

In this program, dynamic programming is used to calculate the minimum length of a triangle that can be formed from a given set of points. The problem is solved by storing the results of previously solved subproblems in an array and using these results to solve larger subproblems.

The DP algorithm used in this program follows a bottom-up approach, where the subproblems are solved in a specific order, starting from the smallest subproblems and working up to the larger ones.

The DP array in this program is a two-dimensional array called **`dp`**, which is used to store the minimum length of a triangle that can be formed from a subset of the points. The **`dp`** array is initialized with all elements set to the maximum value representable by a **`float`** type, which is defined as the **`MAX`** macro.

The DP algorithm then iterates over the points in the array, starting from the smallest subproblems (i.e., triangles formed from three points) and working up to larger ones. For each subproblem, the algorithm considers all possible combinations of points and calculates the minimum length of a triangle that can be formed from those points. The minimum value is then stored in the **`dp`** array for future reference.

Finally, the minimum length of a triangle that can be formed from the entire set of points is obtained by looking up the value in the **`dp`** array at index **`[0][numPoints-1]`**, where **`numPoints`** is the total number of points. This value is then printed to the standard output stream.

In summary, dynamic programming is used in this program to efficiently calculate the minimum length of a triangle that can be formed from a given set of points by solving smaller subproblems and storing the results in an array for future reference.
